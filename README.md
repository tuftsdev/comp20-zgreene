#### What is this purpose of this Git repository? 
This Git repository serves as a portfolio of my work in Web Programming (Comp 20) this semester. It showcases my labs and assignments that have helped me learn to create client-side development.

#### What was your favorite lab or assignment and why?
My favorite assignment was Assignment 2, the Maurauder's Map, because it integrated all of the languages we had been using. It also served a real-world function and looked semi-professional due to its use of the Google Maps API. There was a lot of logic involved in coding the project that was fun to complete. 

#### How much do you think you have grown from day 1 of this course to now?
Much of what I learned was how to learn. A lot of information on web development is publicly available and this class exposed me to those resources and how to use them. I have emerged as an informed web user with a basis for learning more on how to design and develop websites.

#### What was the most important thing that you learned in this course? Cite two examples as evidence.
The most important thing I learned in this course was the principle of web security. Many uneducated users are vulnerable to attacks on the web targeting sensitive information. It is important to protect users privacy and/or government information as a web developer.

I also learned that I should always clear my cookies or use an Incognito browser to search for airline flights so that I don't get ripped off. Our lessons in cookies and local storage helped to engrain this message of permanence on the web.

#### Now that you have finished the course, what topic would you like to delve deeper into?
I'd like to delve deeper into user interface design in the future. Now that I understand how the web works, I am more critical of professional websites and how they could be improved to streamline the usability of the product. I am very motivated by efficiency and this would be a great place to apply these passions.
