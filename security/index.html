<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Description of the product and what I was hired to do</p>

<h3>Methodology</h3>
<p>Describe your methodology when testing the application, including the tools that you used</p>

<h3>Abstract of Findings</h3> 
<p>Provide an overview of all the security and privacy issues you identified. This section should be written for non-technical managers who do not have technical expertise and do not have time to read the entire document. Write this section using lay language.</p>

<h3>Issues Found</h3> 
	<h4>Accessibility of other client's information</h4>
		<ol>
			<li>Issue: Any user can access the stored location and time of all the other users in the database by querying logins that are not equal to their own.</li>
			<li>Location: GET function, /location.json</li>
			<li>Severity of Issue: This issue is of high severity because it allows private information on one's whereabouts to be publicly accessible to users that could be pesky or even dangerous. </li>
			<li>Description of Issue: I found it by typing the following into the URL in the browser. CREATES AN ASSOCIATIVE ARRAY</li>
			<p><img src="issue1URL.png" alt="URL displaying issue"/></p>
			<li>Proof of vulnerability: Another stored user and their information became available to me. It only returned one user's information because his code specifies find(1) in the GET function. PUT NEW SCREENSHOT IN</li>
			<li>Resolution: ENCODE TO TAKE OUT SPECIAL CHARACTERS?</li>
		</ol>

	<h4>Vulnerability to XSS Part 1</h4>
		<ol>
			<li>Issue: Does not prevent against the injection of JavaScript input from users</li>
			<li>Location: POST SEE PIAZZA THING ON THIS</li>
			<li>Severity of Issue: Moderate. The issue is easily preventable (see resolution below), but if not protected against it could allow malicious and persistent re-directs to unsavory websites that are viewable by all users of the page.</li>
			<li>Description of Issue: I found this issue by entering the following text as curl data and refreshing the page to have it redirect to a catchy Kesha video.</li>
			<p><img src="issue2curl.png" alt="terminal input displaying issue"</></p>
			<li>Proof of Vulnerability: The page automatically redirects to the following.</li>
			<p><img src="issue2proof.png" alt="video evidence"</></p>
			<li>Resolution: DISALLOW CHARACTERS SUCH AS < AND USE CHARACTER ENCODING FOR JAVASCRIPT</li>
		</ol>
	<h4>Doesn't accept inputted login info if there is no lat and lng</h4>
<p>For each issue that you find, document:
1. Issue (e.g., database injection, really bad programming practice)
2. Location / page where issue was found
3. Severity of issue (e.g., low, medium , or high). Justify your answer.
4. Description of issue. How did you find it? A screenshot of problem is excellent.
5. Proof of vulnerability.Screenshots are ideal.
6. Resolution
How did you resolve the issue? Show code if possible.</p>
