	<h2>Introduction</h2>
	<p>This assignment documents the security and privacy vulnerabilities associated with a web 
	server and a web application developed by Alex Ravan.</p>

	<p>As detailed by my client's client, this application is meant to retrieve a user's current 
	location and send this location to a separate database. The application retrieves and displays
	the locations of all users on the map.</p>

	<p>I was "hired" to examine the product and provide a report of any security or privacy issues 
	that may cause problems and potential solutions to resolve such concerns.</p>

	<h2>Methodology</h2>
	<p>Testing was initially carried out in a "black box" fashion, wherein the source code was not 
	examined to simulate what an attacker has to work with. I used curl
	 and the URL to manipulate data.</p>

	<p>I then completed "white box" testing to find more precise methods of resolution of the 
	concerns.</p>

	<h2>Abstract of Findings</h2> 
	<p>The security issues identified in this report highlight the general principle that user
	input should not be trusted. Attacks by malicious or pesky users may render the site 
	inaccurate or 'graffiti-ed' with spam content. Other attacks put user privacy at risk via
	the distribution of information related to their precise location. The solutions I offer to 
	amend these concerns involves checking the content that users of the application create 
	before publishing it for all to see.</p>

	<h2>Issues Found</h2> 
		<h4>Injection: Accessibility of other client's information</h4>
			<ol>
				<li>Issue: Any user can access the stored location and time of all the other users in the database by querying logins that are not equal to their own.</li>
				<li>Location: GET function, /location.json</li>
				<li>Severity of Issue: This issue is of high severity because it allows private 
				information on one's whereabouts to be publicly accessible to users that could be 
				pesky or even dangerous. </li>
				<li>Description of Issue: I found it by typing the following into the URL in the 
				browser. Doing so creates an associative array that changes the query to return data
				where the username is not the one entered.</li>
				<p><img src="issue1URL.png" alt="URL displaying issue"/></p>
				<li>Proof of vulnerability: Another stored user and their information became 
				available to me. It only returned one user's information because his code specifies
				 to find only one in the GET function.</li>
				<p><img src="issue1proof.png" alt="page evidence"/></p>
				<li>Resolution: in the GET function, run a url.search to ensure that "login=" has
				 been entered exactly as is such that [$ne] will be excluded. Then run url.slice to 
				 search from that index.</li>
			</ol>

		<h4>Vulnerability to XSS Part 1</h4>
			<ol>
				<li>Issue: Does not prevent against the injection of JavaScript input from users</li>
				<li>Location: Launched attack in HTTP POST, but it is executed upon refresh of the 
				page and thus HTTP GET.</li>
				<li>Severity of Issue: Moderate. The issue is easily preventable (see resolution 
				below), but if not protected against it could allow malicious and persistent re-
				directs to unsavory websites that are viewable by all users of the page.</li>
				<li>Description of Issue: I found this issue by entering the following text as curl 
				data and refreshing the page to have it redirect to a catchy Kesha video.</li>
				<p><img src="issue2curl.png" alt="terminal input displaying issue"</></p>
				<li>Proof of Vulnerability: The page automatically redirects to the following.</li>
				<p><img src="issue2proof.png" alt="video evidence"</></p>
				<li>Resolution: Sanitize input before storing it and use character encoding for 
				JavaScript.</li>
			</ol>

		<h4>Vulnerability to XSS Part 2</h4>
			<ol>
				<li>Issue: Does not prevent against the injection of JavaScript input from users</li>
				<li>Location: Similar to above. Launched attack in HTTP POST, but it is executed upon 
				refresh of the page and thus HTTP GET.</li>
				<li>Severity of Issue: Moderate. The issue is easily preventable (see resolution 
				below), but if not protected against it could allow malicious and persistent display 
				of unsavory images or text that is viewable by all users of the page.</li>
				<li>Description of Issue: I found this issue by entering the following text as curl 
				data. </li>
				<p><img src="issue3curl.png" alt="terminal input displaying issue"</></p>
				<li>Proof of Vulnerability:</li>
				<p><img src="issue3proof.png" alt="photo evidence"</></p>
				<li>Resolution: Similar to above. Sanitize user input before storing it and use 
				character encoding for JavaScript.</li>
			</ol>

		<h4>Ease of Data Manipulation</h4>
			<ol>
				<li>Issue: Users can create false locations or fill the database with multiple 
				entries of the same person under different logins.</li>
				<li>Location: Attack is launched in HTTP POST.</li>
				<li>Severity of Issue: High. The user could run a script to fill the database 
				and exceed storage capacity. Because the app is hosted on Heroku, it could end
				up charging the developer a sum of money. This also ruins the purpose of the 
				site as an accurate map of users.</li>
				<li>Description of Issue: This issue was identified by the fact that I could
				enter scores of curl data to test other features of the site. I was able to 
				repeatedly enter information from my machine with different logins and inaccurate
				latitudes and longitudes. </li>
				<li>Proof of Vulnerability: The following data was all created by me.</li>
				<p><img src="issue4proof.png" alt="photo evidence"</></p>
				<li>Resolution: Connect user information to the IP address of the machine they 
				are connecting from and store this data as cookies so that the user can only use
				one login.</li>
			</ol>


	<h2>Conclusion</h2>

	<p>The issues with The Maurauder's Map in this report mainly deal with the vulnerability of the site to malicious client-side input. All of these issues affect the accuracy and purpose of the site and put the privacy and security of other users at stake. The scheme of the website might also be restructured as it allows users to enter any random latitude and longitude as their location. Changes to protect against other attacks should be fairly simple to account for now that they have been identified. My implementation charge is next semester's tuition. </p>
